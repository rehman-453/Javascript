    Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some images.
    <br>
    If the article is a long piece, there may be subheadings that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those involved. Structure helps readers understand the stories in the newspaper.
    <br>
    <br>
    The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video).
    This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside the corresponding article on its website.
    <br>
    <br>
    Now think about a very different type of document â€” an insurance form. Insurance forms often have headings for different sections, and each section contains a list of questions with areas for you to fill in details or checkboxes to tick.
    <br>
    Again, the structure is very similar online.
    <br>
    <br>
    The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information.
    For example, a document might start with a large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information.
    <br>
    <br>
    This might be expanded upon under subheadings lower down on the page. When using a word processor to create a document, we separate out the text to give it structure. Each topic might have a new paragraph, and each section can have a heading to describe what it covers.
    <br>
    On the right, you can see a simple document in Microsoft Word.
    <br>
    The different styles for the document, such as different levels of heading, are shown in the drop down box. If you regularly use Word, you might have also used the formatting toolbar or palette to do this.

<h3 id="html"><b>1: HTML</b></h3>
<p>
    We will spend the first chapter looking at how HTML is used to create web pages. You will see that you start by writing down the words you want to appear on your page.
    <br>
    You then add tags or elements to the words so that the browser knows what is a heading, where a paragraph begins and ends, and so on. The rest of this section introduces the tags you have at your disposal to create web pages, grouped into chapters on: text, lists, links, images, tables, forms, video audio and flash, and miscellaneous elements.
    <br>
    I should warn you that the examples in the first nine chapters are not exciting to look at, yet they are the foundation of every web page. The following chapters on CSS will show you how to make your pages look a lot more interesting.

<h3 id="css"><b>2: CSS</b></h3>
<p>
    We start this section with a chapter that explains how CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages. We then go on to look at the wide variety of CSS properties you can use in your CSS rules.
    <br>
    These properties generally fall into one of two categories:
    <br>
    Presentation:
    <br>
    How to control things like the color of text, the fonts you want to use and the size of those fonts, how to add background colors to pages (or parts of a page), and how to add background images. Layout: How to control where the different elements are positioned on the screen. You will also learn several techniques that professionals use to make their pages more attractive

<h3 id="practical"><b>3: PRACTICAL</b></h3>
<p>
    Information that will assist you in building better websites. We look at some new tags that will be introduced in HTML5 to help describe the structure of your pages. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML (still under development at the time of writing).
    <br>
    Before learning about these elements, you need a good grasp of how CSS is used to control the design of web pages.
    <br>
    There is a chapter that talks you through a design process that you might like to follow when creating a new website.
    <br>
    Finally, we end up looking at topics that will help you once you have built your site, such as putting it on the web, search engine optimisation (SEO) and using analytics software to track who comes to your site and what they are looking at.
